# Latent Restoration Diffusion Model for Robust Monocular Depth Estimation under Adverse Weather

<!-- This project implements Marigold, a Computer Vision method for estimating image characteristics. Initially proposed for
extracting high-resolution depth maps in our CVPR 2024 paper **"Repurposing Diffusion-Based Image Generators for Monocular 
Depth Estimation"**, we extended the method to other modalities as described in our follow-up paper **"Marigold: Affordable 
Adaptation of Diffusion-Based Image Generators for Image Analysis"**.  -->

1. Finally, local development instructions with this codebase are given below.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

The inference code was tested on:

- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, Python 3.10.12,  CUDA 11.7, GeForce RTX 3090 (pip)

### ü™ß A Note for Windows users

We recommend running the code in WSL2:

1. Install WSL following [installation guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install#install-wsl-command).
1. Install CUDA support for WSL following [installation guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/wsl-user-guide/index.html#cuda-support-for-wsl-2).
1. Find your drives in `/mnt/<drive letter>/`; check [WSL FAQ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/faq#how-do-i-access-my-c--drive-) for more details. Navigate to the working directory of choice. 

### üì¶ Repository

Clone the repository (requires git):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/prs-eth/Marigold.git
cd Marigold
```

### üíª Dependencies

Install the dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv/marigold
source venv/marigold/bin/activate
```

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Keep the environment activated before running the inference script. 
Activate the environment again after restarting the terminal session.

<!-- ### ‚öôÔ∏è Inference settings

The default settings are optimized for the best results. However, the behavior of the code can be customized:

- `--half_precision` or `--fp16`: Run with half-precision (16-bit float) to have faster speed and reduced VRAM usage, but might lead to suboptimal results.

- `--ensemble_size`: Number of inference passes in the ensemble. Larger values tend to give better results in evaluations at the cost of slower inference; for most cases 1 is enough. Default: 1.

- `--denoise_steps`: Number of denoising diffusion steps. Default settings are defined in the model checkpoints and are sufficient for most cases.

- By default, the inference script resizes input images to the *processing resolution*, and then resizes the prediction back to the original resolution. This gives the best quality, as Stable Diffusion, from which Marigold is derived, performs best at 768x768 resolution.  
  
  - `--processing_res`: the processing resolution; set as 0 to process the input resolution directly. When unassigned (`None`), will read default setting from model config. Default: `None`.
  - `--output_processing_res`: produce output at the processing resolution instead of upsampling it to the input resolution. Default: False.
  - `--resample_method`: the resampling method used to resize images and depth predictions. This can be one of `bilinear`, `bicubic`, or `nearest`. Default: `bilinear`.

- `--seed`: Random seed can be set to ensure additional reproducibility. Default: None (unseeded). Note: forcing `--batch_size 1` helps to increase reproducibility. To ensure full reproducibility, [deterministic mode](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/randomness.html#avoiding-nondeterministic-algorithms) needs to be used.
- `--batch_size`: Batch size of repeated inference. Default: 0 (best value determined automatically).
- `--color_map`: [Colormap](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/colors/colormaps.html) used to colorize the depth prediction. Default: Spectral. Set to `None` to skip colored depth map generation.
- `--apple_silicon`: Use Apple Silicon MPS acceleration.


<!-- ### üéÆ Run inference (for academic comparisons)
These settings correspond to our paper. For academic comparison, please run with the settings below (if you only want to do fast inference on your own images, you can set `--ensemble_size 1`).
 -->

You can find all results in the `output` directory. Enjoy!

### ‚¨á Checkpoint cache
By default, the checkpoint ([depth](https://huggingface.co/prs-eth/marigold-depth-v1-1), [normals](https://huggingface.co/prs-eth/marigold-normals-v1-1), [iid](https://huggingface.co/prs-eth/marigold-iid-appearance-v1-1))  is stored in the Hugging Face cache.
The `HF_HOME` environment variable defines its location and can be overridden, e.g.:

```bash
export HF_HOME=$(pwd)/cache
HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER=1 huggingface-cli download stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2
```

Alternatively, use the following script to download the checkpoint weights locally:

```bash
bash script/download_weights.sh marigold-depth-v1-1           # depth checkpoint
```
## ü¶ø Evaluation on test datasets <a name="evaluation"></a>
Install additional dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements+.txt -r requirements.txt
```

Set data directory variable (also needed in evaluation scripts) and download the evaluation datasets into the corresponding subfolders.

Run inference and evaluation scripts, for example:
```bash
bash script/depth/eval/21_infer_kitti.sh
```

```bash
bash script/depth/eval/22_eval_kitti.sh
```
Note: although the seed has been set, the results might still be slightly different on different hardware.
 
## üèãÔ∏è Training
Based on the previously created environment, install extended requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements++.txt -r requirements+.txt -r requirements.txt
```
Set environment parameters for the data directory:
```bash
export BASE_DATA_DIR=YOUR_DATA_DIR        # directory of training data
export BASE_CKPT_DIR=YOUR_CHECKPOINT_DIR  # directory of pretrained checkpoint
```
Download Stable Diffusion v2 [checkpoint](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2) into `${BASE_CKPT_DIR}`

### Prepare for training data
**Depth**
Prepare for [Hypersim](https://github.com/apple/ml-hypersim) and [Virtual KITTI 2](https://europe.naverlabs.com/research/computer-vision/proxy-virtual-worlds-vkitti-2/) datasets and save into `${BASE_DATA_DIR}`. Please refer to [this README](script/depth/dataset_preprocess/hypersim/README.md) for Hypersim preprocessing.

**Normals**
Prepare for [Hypersim](https://github.com/apple/ml-hypersim), [Interiorverse](https://interiorverse.github.io/) and [Sintel](http://sintel.is.tue.mpg.de/) datasets and save into `${BASE_DATA_DIR}`. Please refer to [this README](script/normals/dataset_preprocess/hypersim/README.md) for Hypersim preprocessing, [this README](script/normals/dataset_preprocess/interiorverse/README.md) for Interiorverse and [this README](script/normals/dataset_preprocess/sintel/README.md) for Sintel.

**Intrinsic Image Decomposition**
*Appearance model*: Prepare for [Interiorverse](https://interiorverse.github.io/) dataset and save into `${BASE_DATA_DIR}`. Please refer to [this README](script/iid/dataset_preprocess/interiorverse_appearance/README.md) for Interiorverse preprocessing.

*Lighting model*: Prepare for [Hypersim](https://github.com/apple/ml-hypersim) dataset and save into `${BASE_DATA_DIR}`. Please refer to [this README](script/iid/dataset_preprocess/hypersim_lighting/README.md) for Hypersim preprocessing.

### Run training script
```bash
python script/depth/train.py --config config/train_weather_depth.yaml
python script/depth/train_latent.py --config config/train_rasmit_latent.yaml
```
Resume from a checkpoint, e.g.:

```bash
python script/depth/train.py --resume_run output/train_weather_depth/checkpoint/latest
```

### Compose checkpoint:
Only the U-Net and scheduler config are updated during training. They are saved in the training directory. To use the inference pipeline with your training result:
- replace `unet` folder in Marigold checkpoints with that in the `checkpoint` output folder.
- replace the `scheduler/scheduler_config.json` file in Marigold checkpoints with `checkpoint/scheduler_config.json` generated during training.
Then refer to [this section](#evaluation) for evaluation.

**Note**: Although random seeds have been set, the training result might be slightly different on different hardwares. It's recommended to train without interruption.
